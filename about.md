### About Us

At My-Super.App, our mission is rooted in the belief that access to affordable Bitcoin Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSF) should be a universal right, not a privilege reserved for a select few. We champion the cause of self-custody, asserting that every individual should have the power and freedom to directly manage their retirement savings. Our journey is driven by a commitment to democratize the financial landscape, ensuring that the transformative potential of Bitcoin is accessible to all, fostering financial independence and security for a brighter future.

#### Our Philosophy: Empowerment through Innovation

We believe in the power of Bitcoin to revolutionize the concept of retirement savings. By combining the principles of self-custody with the innovative technology of blockchain, we offer a platform that not only empowers you to take control of your financial future but also does so in a way that's both affordable and accessible. Our focus on automating the complexities of SMSF management allows us to reduce costs significantly, making the dream of a self-managed retirement fund a reality for everyone.
