# Embark on a Financial Revolution with My-Super.App: Making SMSF Affordable for All

Welcome to a new dawn of retirement planning with My-Super.App, where the pioneering spirit of Bitcoin meets the accessibility of Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSF) at a cost that's truly within reach for everyone. Traditionally, the privilege of managing a personal SMSF in Australia came with a hefty price tag of around 3000 AUD annually, a figure that often placed it beyond the reach of the average individual and squarely in the realm of the affluent. My-Super.App shatters this barrier by offering an innovative, self-custodial Bitcoin SMSF service at just a third of the cost, making it an accessible option for all Australians eager to take control of their retirement destiny.

At My-Super.App, we believe that financial security and independence should not be exclusive. Our mission is to democratize retirement planning, making it accessible and affordable for every individual looking to secure their future.
