In October 2008, a whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was posted to a cryptography mailing list by an individual using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This whitepaper outlined the concept of a digital currency that operated on a decentralized ledger known as the blockchain. In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software and mined the genesis block, the foundation of the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Impact on the World

Satoshi Nakamoto's creation, Bitcoin, has had a profound impact on the world in several ways:

1. Decentralization and Financial Inclusion: Bitcoin introduced a decentralized financial system, where transactions are not controlled by a central authority like a bank or government. This has implications for financial inclusion, especially in regions with unstable currencies or limited access to traditional banking.

2. Digital Store of Value: Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold" due to its properties as a store of value. It has gained popularity as an asset class for investment, similar to gold, especially in times of economic uncertainty.

3. Impact on Global Financial Markets: Bitcoin has become a significant player in the global financial markets, with its price movements attracting attention from individual investors, financial institutions, and governments.

4. Cultural and Social Phenomenon: Beyond its economic and technological implications, Bitcoin has become a cultural and social phenomenon, influencing popular culture, art, and media, and sparking a movement advocating for a decentralized financial future.

Whilst their identity is a great mystery, there are three most likely candidates that are suspected to be "Satoshi Nakamoto", these few being, Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, Adam Back and Len Sassaman. 

Satoshi's vision of a decentralized, trustless money continues to shape the future of finance, technology, and beyond.
