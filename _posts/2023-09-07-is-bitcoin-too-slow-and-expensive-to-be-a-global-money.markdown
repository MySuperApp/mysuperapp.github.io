## The concerns about Bitcoin being too slow and expensive for use as a global currency are valid and highlight some of the inherent limitations of its original design. However, these concerns also need to be contextualized within the ongoing developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let's break down the key points:


### Transaction Speed

#### Block Time: 
Bitcoin's network processes a block approximately every 10 minutes. This can lead to delays during times of high transaction volume.

#### Scalability: 
The Bitcoin blockchain can handle around 3 to 7 transactions per second (tps). Compared to traditional financial systems like Visa, which can handle thousands of tps, Bitcoin's throughput is quite low.


### Transaction Costs

#### Variable Fees: 
Bitcoin transaction fees can vary greatly depending on network congestion. During peak times, fees can become quite high, making small transactions economically unviable.

#### Priority to Higher Fees: 
Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees. During times of congestion, users need to pay more to have their transactions processed quickly.


### Comparisons with Traditional Methods

#### Different Use Case: 
Bitcoin is often compared to payment systems like Visa or PayPal, but it was designed primarily as a decentralized digital currency, not a high-speed payment processing system.

#### Store of Value vs. Medium of Exchange: 
Many view Bitcoin more as a digital gold or store of value rather than a currency for everyday transactions, partly due to these speed and cost issues.

### Developments and Solutions

#### Layer 2 Solutions: 
Technologies like the Lightning Network, a second layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, aim to address these issues. The Lightning Network allows for faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off the main blockchain.

#### Sidechains and Other Technologies: 
Other solutions involve sidechains or integrating other blockchain technologies that can help scale Bitcoin and reduce transaction costs.

#### Continued Development: 
The Bitcoin protocol is continually being developed and improved. While it may not currently offer the speed and low cost needed for all types of transactions, ongoing innovations are working towards addressing these limitations.

### Conclusion 

As it stands, Bitcoin does face challenges with transaction speed and costs that might limit its use as a day-to-day global currency. However, it's important to recognize the evolving nature of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency space. With developments like the Lightning Network and other technological innovations, Bitcoin is adapting, potentially paving the way for broader utility in global finance. Whether it will become a universally used form of money remains to be seen, but its role as a store of value and a subject of continuous innovation is undeniable.
